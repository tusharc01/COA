The video "[Lec 23 & 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od69hy9Y4s8&list=PLL7q95_bHxC56PtT1t-21A-NmUf7yBjGs&index=14&pp=iAQB): Processor Design Part 1" focuses on **processor design**, specifically how a Simple RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) assembly language can be translated and implemented in hardware. The core idea is to break down the execution of an instruction into multiple, independently designed stages to improve efficiency.

### 1. Basic Approach to Processor Design
The fundamental approach is to **divide the entire instruction processing into different stages**, with each stage designed and implemented separately. This concept is analogous to an **assembly line** in car manufacturing, where a product moves through different stages, and different parts are assembled at each stage until the final product is complete. Similarly, an instruction will progress through various stages, each handled by separate modules.

### 2. The Five Stages of Processor Execution
The processor design is broadly divided into five stages:

*   **Instruction Fetch (IF):** The first task is to **fetch the instruction from memory**.
*   **Operand Fetch (OF) / Decode:** This stage involves **understanding what the instruction is supposed to do** and fetching the necessary operands.
*   **Execute (EX):** In this stage, arithmetic, logical, or other operations are performed, and branch outcomes are figured out.
*   **Memory Access (MA):** This stage is where load and store kind of memory accesses are executed.
*   **Register Write (RW) / Write Back:** The final stage where data is written back to the register file.

### 3. Detailed Design of Each Stage

#### a. Instruction Fetch (IF) Stage
The IF stage primarily performs two tasks:
*   **Fetches the instruction** from the instruction memory.
*   **Computes the address of the next instruction**.

The hardware for this stage includes:
*   **Program Counter (PC):** A 32-bit register that holds the address of the current instruction. It is updated at the negative edge of the clock signal.
*   **Instruction Memory:** A black box (at this stage of discussion) from which the 32-bit instruction is read based on the PC's address.
*   **PC Update Logic:**
    *   If there's no branch instruction, the next instruction's address is simply `PC + 4` (since each instruction is 4 bytes).
    *   If there's a branch, the new address comes from a different stage (Operand Fetch or Execute).
    *   A **2-to-1 Multiplexer** selects the next PC. Its control signal, "is branch taken," determines whether `PC + 4` or the "new PC" (branch target) is selected.
    *   The "is branch taken" signal is generated by the **execution unit** (for conditional branches like `beq`, `bgt`), or it might be always zero for non-branch instructions, or always high for unconditional branches (like `call`, `return`).

In essence, the IF unit uses the PC to access instruction memory, gets the instruction, and then updates the PC for the next cycle.

#### b. Operand Fetch (OF) / Decode Stage
This is described as a **pretty extensive and potentially time-consuming phase**. It involves several crucial operations:
*   **Decode the instruction:** The upper 5 bits of the 32-bit instruction are the opcode, which identifies the instruction (e.g., 21 instructions in Simple RISC require 5 bits). This involves breaking the instruction into its different fields (source registers, destination register, etc.).
*   **Fetch register operands:** If the instruction requires register operands (e.g., `add r1, r2, r3`), their values are fetched from the **register file**. Simple RISC has 16 general-purpose registers.
*   **Compute branch target:** For branch instructions (unconditional jump, call, return), the new PC address (`PC + offset`) is calculated using an offset value provided in the instruction.
*   **Compute immediate value:** If an operand is an immediate value (16-bit with 2-bit modifiers), it needs to be converted to a 32-bit value. Modifiers specify sign extension (default), zero extension for unsigned (`u` modifier), or placing the 16-bit value in the higher two bytes with lower bytes zeroed (`h` modifier).
*   **Generate control signals:** Various control signals are generated based on the decoded instruction to manage the subsequent stages.

#### c. Execution (EX) Stage
This stage primarily contains the **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)**.
*   **Performs all arithmetic operations:** Such as add, subtract, multiplication, division, compare, and modulo.
*   **Performs all logical operations:** Such as AND, OR, NOT.
*   **Contains a branch unit:** This unit is responsible for **computing branch conditions** for instructions like `beq` (branch if equal) or `bgt` (branch if greater than).
*   **Updates the flag register:** The flag register (not present in MIPS32, but conceptually discussed here) is updated based on the outcome of a compare (`cmp`) instruction.

#### d. Memory Access (MA) Stage
This stage is relatively simple:
*   It **interfaces with the memory system**.
*   It **executes load and store instructions**.

#### e. Register Write (RW) Stage
This is the final stage where results are written back:
*   **Writes to the register file:** This happens when an ALU operation updates a register.
*   **Updates the return address register (RA):** In case of a `call` instruction, the return address (PC of the instruction after the call) needs to be stored in the RA register (register number 15 in Simple RISC).

### 4. Data Path and Control Path
These are two fundamental concepts in processor design:
*   **Data Path:** Consists of all processor elements dedicated to **storing, retrieving, and processing data**. Examples include **register files, memory, and the ALU**. It's analogous to "cars moving on the road".
*   **Control Path:** Primarily contains the **control unit**, whose sole responsibility is to **generate appropriate control signals** to manipulate the flow and operations of data. It's analogous to "traffic signals" that control data flow. The control unit receives inputs like the opcode and immediate bit from the instruction.

### 5. Instruction Formats (Recap)
The video briefly recaps the three broad categories of Simple RISC instructions:
*   **Branch Instructions:** Contain a 5-bit opcode and a 27-bit offset. This offset is a "word offset" and needs to be shifted left by two bits and then sign-extended to a 32-bit value to get the actual branch address. The most significant bit of the 5-bit opcode is '1' for branch instructions, aiding quick decoding.
*   **Register-only Instructions:** Have a 5-bit opcode, an "immediate bit" (which is 0 for these instructions), and then 4-bit fields for the destination register (26-23), source 1 register (22-19), and source 2 register (18-15).
*   **Immediate Instructions:** Have a 5-bit opcode, an "immediate bit" (which is 1 for these instructions), fields for a destination register, a source register, and an 18-bit immediate value (comprising 2-bit modifiers and 16-bit actual immediate value).

### 6. Parallel Processing in Operand Fetch Stage
A key design choice for performance is to **perform operations in parallel** within the Operand Fetch stage, even if some results might be unnecessary.
*   When an instruction is fetched, the hardware doesn't immediately know its type (branch, register-only, or immediate).
*   To avoid compromising performance, the design employs **three parallel units** to deal with these three cases simultaneously.
*   For example, it will **assume it's a branch instruction** and calculate `PC + offset` in parallel. Similarly, it will **assume it's an immediate instruction** and convert the immediate value to 32 bits in parallel.
*   Though this means **unnecessary calculations** might occur (e.g., calculating a branch target even if it's not a branch instruction), it **saves time** because the results are ready when needed. The appropriate result is then picked, and the other useless outcomes are ignored.

#### a. Register File Read Module (within OF)
This module handles reading register operands:
*   It has **two read ports** for reading source registers (RS1, RS2).
*   **Special handling for `return` instruction:** If the instruction is `return`, instead of a source register, the return address register RA(15) is read, and its content becomes `operand 1`. A multiplexer (isRet) selects between RS1 and RA based on a control signal.
*   **Special handling for `store` instruction:** For a `store` instruction, the value to be stored in memory is typically in the destination register (RD field in the instruction format). Since `store` doesn't have a true destination register, this RD field is used to specify the source register whose value needs to be stored. This value is read and outputted as `operand 2`. Another multiplexer (isSt) selects between RS2 and this special RD read.

#### b. Immediate and Branch Unit (within OF)
This unit performs parallel calculations for immediate values and branch targets:
*   It **shifts the 27-bit offset** from the instruction by 2 bits left and then sign-extends it to a 32-bit offset to calculate the **branch target (PC + offset)**.
*   It **takes the 18-bit immediate value** and uses the modifiers to calculate the 32-bit immediate value.
*   These calculations are done **parallelly**, regardless of the instruction type, to ensure that the results are available without delay if they are eventually needed.

The **overall Operand Fetch unit** combines these parts, taking the PC and instruction from the Fetch unit. The control unit receives the opcode and immediate bit to generate all necessary control signals for the multiplexers and other logic within the OF unit.

In video "[Lec 25 & 26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1b60NAgrng&list=PLL7q95_bHxC56PtT1t-21A-NmUf7yBjGs&index=15&pp=iAQB): Building upon our previous discussion about processor design, where we introduced the five stages of instruction processing and delved into the **Instruction Fetch (IF)** and **Operand Fetch (OF)** units, this response will provide a comprehensive explanation of the remaining stages: **Execution (EX)**, **Memory Access (MA)**, **Register Write (RW)**, and the **Control Unit**.

### 1. Recap of Operand Fetch (OF) Unit and its Outputs
The Operand Fetch unit is crucial as it prepares all necessary data for subsequent stages. Its primary role is to **decode the instruction** and **fetch all possible operands in parallel**, to avoid performance delays. This parallel evaluation means that even if an instruction doesn't require a particular operand type (like an immediate value or a branch target), those values are still calculated, and the unneeded results are simply discarded later.

The OF unit provides four primary outputs to the next stage:
*   **Immediate values**: If the instruction contains an immediate operand, this is converted to its 32-bit representation.
*   **Branch target**: For branch instructions, the potential next PC address is calculated (`PC + offset`).
*   **Operand 1 (op1)**: Typically the value of the first source register (RS1). However, for a `return` instruction, a multiplexer selects the content of the **Return Address Register (RA15)** to be output as op1.
*   **Operand 2 (op2)**: Typically the value of the second source register (RS2). Uniquely for `store` instructions, the **RD (destination register) field** of the instruction is read to determine *which register's value needs to be stored*, and that value is output as op2.

### 2. Execution (EX) Unit
The Execution unit is where the primary computation for an instruction takes place. It receives the immediate values, branch target, op1, and op2 from the Operand Fetch unit as its inputs.

#### a. Branch Unit
Within the EX unit, a **branch unit** determines if a branch instruction should be taken, which is critical for updating the Program Counter (PC) in the Instruction Fetch unit.
*   It generates the `is branch taken` signal by checking **flag status** and the instruction type.
*   For **conditional branches** like `beq` (branch if equal), it checks `flags.e` (equal flag). For `bgt` (branch if greater than), it checks `flags.gt` (greater than flag). If both the relevant flag is set and the instruction matches (e.g., `beq` and `flags.e` is high), then the branch is taken.
*   For **unconditional branches**, the `is branch taken` signal is directly set to high.
*   An **OR gate** combines these conditions; if any of them are true, the `is branch taken` signal is asserted.

The EX unit also calculates the **updated PC (branch PC)** for the next instruction.
*   A multiplexer selects the next PC. If the instruction is a **`return` instruction**, the PC is updated with the value of the Return Address Register (RA), which was provided as `op1` from the OF unit.
*   If it's **not a `return` instruction**, the **branch target address** calculated in the OF unit is used to update the PC.

#### b. Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
The ALU is the core of the EX unit, performing all arithmetic and logical operations.
*   **Inputs (Operands A and B)**:
    *   **Operand A**: Always comes directly from the first source operand, `op1` (a register value).
    *   **Operand B**: This is chosen via a multiplexer. If the instruction's **immediate bit is high**, the 32-bit `immediate value` (generated in OF) is selected as Operand B. If the **immediate bit is low**, `op2` (typically a register value) is selected.
*   **ALU Operation**: The specific operation (add, subtract, AND, OR, etc.) is determined by `ALU signals` provided by the control unit.
*   **Output**: The ALU produces an `ALU result`.

#### c. Internal Functions of the ALU
The ALU is designed to handle a variety of operations:
*   **Adder**: Used for `add` instructions and also for **calculating memory addresses** in load/store instructions (base register + offset).
*   **Subtracter**: Implemented by converting the number to be subtracted into its **two's complement** and then performing addition.
*   **Comparison**: Also performed via **subtraction**. If the result is zero, the numbers are equal; if positive, the first is greater. This outcome updates the **flags register** (e.g., `flags.e`, `flags.gt`) which are then used by the branch unit.
*   **Multiplier**: A dedicated hardware unit performs multiplication.
*   **Divider**: A dedicated unit that can output either the **quotient** (for division) or the **remainder** (for modulo operation).
*   **Shift Operations**: Handles logical and arithmetic shifts (left and right).
*   **Logical Operations**: Performs operations like AND, OR, NOT.
*   **Move Instruction**: Also handled at the ALU level.

In summary, the Execution unit combines the branch logic and the ALU to perform computations, update flags, and determine the next PC for branches.

### 3. Memory Access (MA) Unit
The Memory Access unit is dedicated to handling **load and store instructions**, interacting directly with the data memory.

#### a. Load Instruction
For a `load` instruction (e.g., `load r1, offset(base)`):
*   **Address Calculation**: The **address** from which to load data is calculated in the ALU (base + offset) during the EX stage, and this result (`ALU result`) is passed to the MA unit.
*   **Data Fetch**: This `ALU result` (address) is sent to the **data memory**. The data located at that address is then fetched.
*   **Output**: The fetched data is outputted as `load result` from the memory access unit, which will be used in the next stage to write back to a register.

#### b. Store Instruction
For a `store` instruction (e.g., `store r2, offset(base)`):
*   **Address Calculation**: Similar to load, the **memory address** where the data needs to be stored is calculated by the ALU (`ALU result`) and provided to the MA unit.
*   **Data to Store**: The **value to be stored** comes from `op2`, which was read from the source register specified by the RD field of the `store` instruction in the Operand Fetch stage.
*   **Process**: The `ALU result` (address) tells the data memory *where* to store, and `op2` (data) tells it *what* to store. This data is then written into the memory location. Unlike load, there is **no direct output** from the MA unit for a store instruction.

The MA unit uses temporary registers (like `memory address register` and `memory data register`) and control signals (`load` or `store`) to manage these operations.

### 4. Register Writeback (RW) Unit
The Register Writeback unit is the final stage where the results of operations are written back into the **register file**. This stage is critical because an incorrect write can overwrite valid data, leading to errors that are difficult to recover from.

#### a. Write Enable
*   Before any write operation, a control signal called `is write back required` must be asserted. If this signal is not high, no writing will occur, ensuring data integrity.

#### b. Destination Register (Where to Write)
The RW unit needs to determine *which* register in the register file should be updated. There are two main possibilities, selected by a multiplexer:
*   **Destination Register (RD)**: For most arithmetic and logical operations, the result is written to the destination register specified by bits 26-23 in the instruction.
*   **Return Address Register (RA15)**: If the instruction is a **`call` instruction**, the return address needs to be stored in the RA register. This address is selected for the write port.

#### c. Data to Write (What to Write)
The data that needs to be written back can come from three different sources, selected by another multiplexer based on control signals:
*   **ALU Result**: This is the outcome of arithmetic or logical operations performed in the EX stage.
*   **Load Result**: This is the data fetched from memory by a `load` instruction in the MA stage.
*   **PC + 4**: For a **`call` instruction**, the return address (the address of the instruction immediately following the `call`) is calculated as `current PC + 4`. This calculated address is the data that gets written into the Return Address Register (RA).

Control signals (e.g., `is load instruction`, `is call instruction`) manage which of these three data sources is selected to be written into the chosen destination register.

### 5. Control Unit
The **Control Unit** is the "brain" of the processor, responsible for **generating all the necessary control signals** that govern the flow and operation of data throughout all five stages. It ensures that data moves correctly and operations are performed as intended.

#### a. Inputs and Outputs
*   **Inputs**: The control unit primarily takes the **5-bit opcode** and the **1-bit immediate flag** from the instruction as its inputs.
*   **Outputs**: It generates a wide array of control signals for every part of the processor, including:
    *   Signals for identifying instruction types (e.g., `is store`, `is load`, `is branch`, `is call`, `is return`, `is branch if equal`, `is branch if greater than`, `is immediate bit high`).
    *   Signals for controlling the Register Write stage (e.g., `is write back required`, which specifies whether any register should be updated).
    *   Signals to specify ALU operations (e.g., `is add`, `is compare`, `is multiply`, `is division`, `is mod`, `is shift`, `is or`, `is move`).

#### b. Hardware Control Unit
*   This is the most common and preferred method for high-performance applications.
*   It is implemented using **combinational logic circuits** (a "hardwired" design) that directly generate the control signals based on the opcode and immediate bit inputs.
*   The logic for generating these signals is determined by the instruction set's encoding.
*   **Advantage**: Provides **much better performance** because the control logic is directly implemented in hardware, allowing for fast signal generation.

#### c. Microprogrammed Control Unit (Alternative)
*   This approach is less common for high-performance processors.
*   Instead of hardwired logic, the control unit's behavior is defined by a **firmware** (a layer between software and hardware) that contains "microcode".
*   **Concept**: A programmer can write higher-level, more complex "microprogrammed instructions" (e.g., an instruction to add three numbers, or to perform factorial, or multiply-accumulate operation) that are not directly supported by the core hardware instruction set.
*   **Translation**: The firmware then translates these single, complex microprogrammed instructions into **multiple, simpler "micro instructions"** that the underlying hardware can execute.
*   **Advantages**: Offers **more flexibility for programmers** to define custom or complex operations as single instructions, simplifying program writing.
*   **Disadvantages**: Generally **slower performance** compared to hardware control units due to the added translation layer and the more generic nature of the implementation to accommodate varied instructions. It introduces overhead that reduces efficiency.

The processor design discussed, encompassing these five stages (IF, OF, EX, MA, RW) and a robust control unit, lays the foundation for understanding how instructions are executed. The next step in improving processor performance, as mentioned, is **pipelining**.
