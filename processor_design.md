The core idea is to break down the execution of an instruction into multiple, independently designed stages to improve efficiency.

### 1. Basic Approach to Processor Design
The fundamental approach is to **divide the entire instruction processing into different stages**, with each stage designed and implemented separately. This concept is analogous to an **assembly line** in car manufacturing, where a product moves through different stages, and different parts are assembled at each stage until the final product is complete. Similarly, an instruction will progress through various stages, each handled by separate modules.

### 2. The Five Stages of Processor Execution
The processor design is broadly divided into five stages:

*   **Instruction Fetch (IF):** The first task is to **fetch the instruction from memory**.
*   **Operand Fetch (OF) / Decode:** This stage involves **understanding what the instruction is supposed to do** and fetching the necessary operands.
*   **Execute (EX):** In this stage, arithmetic, logical, or other operations are performed, and branch outcomes are figured out.
*   **Memory Access (MA):** This stage is where load and store kind of memory accesses are executed.
*   **Register Write (RW) / Write Back:** The final stage where data is written back to the register file.

### 3. Detailed Design of Each Stage

#### a. Instruction Fetch (IF) Stage
The IF stage primarily performs two tasks:
*   **Fetches the instruction** from the instruction memory.
*   **Computes the address of the next instruction**.

The hardware for this stage includes:
*   **Program Counter (PC):** A 32-bit register that holds the address of the current instruction. It is updated at the negative edge of the clock signal.
*   **Instruction Memory:** A black box (at this stage of discussion) from which the 32-bit instruction is read based on the PC's address.
*   **PC Update Logic:**
    *   If there's no branch instruction, the next instruction's address is simply `PC + 4` (since each instruction is 4 bytes).
    *   If there's a branch, the new address comes from a different stage (Operand Fetch or Execute).
    *   A **2-to-1 Multiplexer** selects the next PC. Its control signal, "is branch taken," determines whether `PC + 4` or the "new PC" (branch target) is selected.
    *   The "is branch taken" signal is generated by the **execution unit** (for conditional branches like `beq`, `bgt`), or it might be always zero for non-branch instructions, or always high for unconditional branches (like `call`, `return`).

In essence, the IF unit uses the PC to access instruction memory, gets the instruction, and then updates the PC for the next cycle.

#### b. Operand Fetch (OF) / Decode Stage
This is described as a **pretty extensive and potentially time-consuming phase**. It involves several crucial operations:
*   **Decode the instruction:** The upper 5 bits of the 32-bit instruction are the opcode, which identifies the instruction (e.g., 21 instructions in Simple RISC require 5 bits). This involves breaking the instruction into its different fields (source registers, destination register, etc.).
*   **Fetch register operands:** If the instruction requires register operands (e.g., `add r1, r2, r3`), their values are fetched from the **register file**. Simple RISC has 16 general-purpose registers.
*   **Compute branch target:** For branch instructions (unconditional jump, call, return), the new PC address (`PC + offset`) is calculated using an offset value provided in the instruction.
*   **Compute immediate value:** If an operand is an immediate value (16-bit with 2-bit modifiers), it needs to be converted to a 32-bit value. Modifiers specify sign extension (default), zero extension for unsigned (`u` modifier), or placing the 16-bit value in the higher two bytes with lower bytes zeroed (`h` modifier).
*   **Generate control signals:** Various control signals are generated based on the decoded instruction to manage the subsequent stages.

#### c. Execution (EX) Stage
This stage primarily contains the **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)**.
*   **Performs all arithmetic operations:** Such as add, subtract, multiplication, division, compare, and modulo.
*   **Performs all logical operations:** Such as AND, OR, NOT.
*   **Contains a branch unit:** This unit is responsible for **computing branch conditions** for instructions like `beq` (branch if equal) or `bgt` (branch if greater than).
*   **Updates the flag register:** The flag register (not present in MIPS32, but conceptually discussed here) is updated based on the outcome of a compare (`cmp`) instruction.

#### d. Memory Access (MA) Stage
This stage is relatively simple:
*   It **interfaces with the memory system**.
*   It **executes load and store instructions**.

#### e. Register Write (RW) Stage
This is the final stage where results are written back:
*   **Writes to the register file:** This happens when an ALU operation updates a register.
*   **Updates the return address register (RA):** In case of a `call` instruction, the return address (PC of the instruction after the call) needs to be stored in the RA register (register number 15 in Simple RISC).

### 4. Data Path and Control Path
These are two fundamental concepts in processor design:
*   **Data Path:** Consists of all processor elements dedicated to **storing, retrieving, and processing data**. Examples include **register files, memory, and the ALU**. It's analogous to "cars moving on the road".
*   **Control Path:** Primarily contains the **control unit**, whose sole responsibility is to **generate appropriate control signals** to manipulate the flow and operations of data. It's analogous to "traffic signals" that control data flow. The control unit receives inputs like the opcode and immediate bit from the instruction.

### 5. Instruction Formats (Recap)
The video briefly recaps the three broad categories of Simple RISC instructions:
*   **Branch Instructions:** Contain a 5-bit opcode and a 27-bit offset. This offset is a "word offset" and needs to be shifted left by two bits and then sign-extended to a 32-bit value to get the actual branch address. The most significant bit of the 5-bit opcode is '1' for branch instructions, aiding quick decoding.
*   **Register-only Instructions:** Have a 5-bit opcode, an "immediate bit" (which is 0 for these instructions), and then 4-bit fields for the destination register (26-23), source 1 register (22-19), and source 2 register (18-15).
*   **Immediate Instructions:** Have a 5-bit opcode, an "immediate bit" (which is 1 for these instructions), fields for a destination register, a source register, and an 18-bit immediate value (comprising 2-bit modifiers and 16-bit actual immediate value).

### 6. Parallel Processing in Operand Fetch Stage
A key design choice for performance is to **perform operations in parallel** within the Operand Fetch stage, even if some results might be unnecessary.
*   When an instruction is fetched, the hardware doesn't immediately know its type (branch, register-only, or immediate).
*   To avoid compromising performance, the design employs **three parallel units** to deal with these three cases simultaneously.
*   For example, it will **assume it's a branch instruction** and calculate `PC + offset` in parallel. Similarly, it will **assume it's an immediate instruction** and convert the immediate value to 32 bits in parallel.
*   Though this means **unnecessary calculations** might occur (e.g., calculating a branch target even if it's not a branch instruction), it **saves time** because the results are ready when needed. The appropriate result is then picked, and the other useless outcomes are ignored.

#### a. Register File Read Module (within OF)
This module handles reading register operands:
*   It has **two read ports** for reading source registers (RS1, RS2).
*   **Special handling for `return` instruction:** If the instruction is `return`, instead of a source register, the return address register RA(15) is read, and its content becomes `operand 1`. A multiplexer (isRet) selects between RS1 and RA based on a control signal.
*   **Special handling for `store` instruction:** For a `store` instruction, the value to be stored in memory is typically in the destination register (RD field in the instruction format). Since `store` doesn't have a true destination register, this RD field is used to specify the source register whose value needs to be stored. This value is read and outputted as `operand 2`. Another multiplexer (isSt) selects between RS2 and this special RD read.

#### b. Immediate and Branch Unit (within OF)
This unit performs parallel calculations for immediate values and branch targets:
*   It **shifts the 27-bit offset** from the instruction by 2 bits left and then sign-extends it to a 32-bit offset to calculate the **branch target (PC + offset)**.
*   It **takes the 18-bit immediate value** and uses the modifiers to calculate the 32-bit immediate value.
*   These calculations are done **parallelly**, regardless of the instruction type, to ensure that the results are available without delay if they are eventually needed.

The **overall Operand Fetch unit** combines these parts, taking the PC and instruction from the Fetch unit. The control unit receives the opcode and immediate bit to generate all necessary control signals for the multiplexers and other logic within the OF unit.
